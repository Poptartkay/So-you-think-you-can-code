### The challenge
​
User Story - 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria -
 GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

### What I learned
​
In this challenge we were meant to make a quiz showing how to use localstorage to keep track of scores and a timer that will deduce with the wrong answer.
I was able to show how to properly use localstorage but definitely unsucessful at the timer. This also helped understand how to use css a bit more, like 
how to use flexbox as well as some styling issues I've had in past assignments.

​

​
### Continued development

As I stated before, I was unsucessful with adding in the timer, I will most likely go back and re-add that in.

### The challenge
​
User Story - 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria -
 GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over

### What I learned
​
What I learned doing this challenge is how to set up a quiz while using HTML/JavaScript/ and CSS. As well learning how to properly input localstorage with JS.
The hardest things I learned while doing this challenge is the how to use the local storage as well as some CSS issues (i.e. using flex-box and getting the quiz to center)
Overall this was a challenging experience but I feel it helped me understand as well as how to properly use these tools.

### Continued development

We were supposed to add a timer on to this challenge, and while my attempts where there, I was unsucessful, going forward I am going to try to implement it.
